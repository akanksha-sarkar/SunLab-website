title: Interpreting Animal Behavior Through Generative Models
description: |
  Using transformer-based generative models to forecast the frame-by-frame social behavior of fruit flies. By examining the internal mechanisms of these models, we aim to bridge computational representations with our biological understanding of real-world animal behavior.

This project uses Transformer-based generative models to forecast the frame-by-frame social behavior of fruit flies. By examining the internal mechanisms of these models, we aim to bridge computational representations with our biological understanding of real-world animal behavior.
