title: Extracting Internal Algorithms in Pre-trained LLM In-Context Learning
description: |
  This project investigates how pre-trained large language models achieve near-optimal prediction on hidden Markov models through in-context learning. Since HMMs represent a challenging statistical learning problem without a known optimal Bayesian learner, uncovering the internal mechanisms these models use could deepen our theoretical understanding of HMM learning itself.
