title: AI Agents for Algorithm Discovery
description: |
  Investigating how agentic AI systems can automatically discover algorithms for challenging scientific inference problems, with a focus on multi-channel whale call association in bioacoustics. We frame association as an agentic program synthesis problem and train agents through iterative evaluation on physics-inspired simulations, reducing reliance on manual annotation and hand-crafted heuristics. Our emerging constraint-aware algorithms show strong generalization across simulated conditions and promising transfer to real-world datasets.
